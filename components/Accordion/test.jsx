    Fryderyk Chopin was born in Å»elazowa Wola, 46 kilometres west of Warsaw, in
    what was then the Duchy of Warsaw, a Polish state established by Napoleon.
    The parish baptismal record gives his birthday as 22 February 1810, and
    cites his given names in the Latin form Fridericus Franciscus (in Polish, he
    was Fryderyk Franciszek). However, the composer and his family used the
    birthdate 1 March, which is now generally accepted as the correct date.
